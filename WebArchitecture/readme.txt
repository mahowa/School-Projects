This project mocks up the for that will be used to keep 
track of graduate student progress. It does not use a 
db therefore all data is static. 

I chose to use divs to make a table because when resizing 
so does the table. I also chose large controls and did my best
to keep the color scheme. Unfortunatley Im partially color blind 
so please dont dock me for that.

I really spent most of my time with css and have grown to really like it.
I dedicated a good chunck of time to the nav bar.

Testing strat was to refresh the browser. Not much else
